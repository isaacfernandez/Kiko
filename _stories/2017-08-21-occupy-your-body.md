The Heartbreaker Papers, the media was calling them. Some contractor in the government had revealed that Garland Silicon, the largest supplier of medical implants and electronics, gave the state realtime access to biometrics.

The following morning Times Square was silent, billboards dark. The ticker ran only one headline.
