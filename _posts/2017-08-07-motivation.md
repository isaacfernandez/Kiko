Cybersecurity is a huge field with a lot to learn. There is a lot of interesting stuff. Between those two, I struggle with two problems: Motivation and focus.

There's a long path ahead of me before I reach where I want to be and can consider myself 1337. I love this field, but it can be demoralizing struggling to do what people consider to be a basic task (setting up BIND, anyone?), or being blown away by others who are so much more driven and learn much faster while accomplishing so much more. It's easy to brush off sometimes, but other times it provides for a good excuse to check out.

The other half of the motivation problem for me could be summed up as inertia. Starting new tasks is really hard. If nothing is rushing me, I can take an hour just to get out of bed. I'm very much a 'start homework the day before the due date.' Procrastinating on my career is something that just does not work long term. 

Thankfully, the world of infosec is cool. Usually the news are enough to remember what excites me about the field. When it isn't, pop culture provides the excited. Hacker/ Computer Sci-Fi 

I'm defining focus here as being able to stay on a singular task and see it through to completion. This has never been my forte: In high school, I would love learning how to solve a problem and set up the solution. I was never one to carry things out. When programming, the last half of a program is the hardest part for me to write. I'll feel like I know what the solution is like, so why waste the time?

It's not a good mindset, but it's the one I tend to fall into a lot. Figuring out the solution to a problem is infinitely more satisfying than implementation.

In a nice touch of irony, this is the problem I have yet to find a good solution for.
