People who know me know that I do not consider myself particularly artistic. I can discuss trivia related to the Arts. I memorized a few poems in high school that I love referencing. However, I haven't produced anything that would be considered within the realm of creativity (code/programming as an art is a separate debate). 

Not since high school at least. While thinking of this topic I realized I enjoyed non-fiction writing back then but never bothered outside of school assignments. Not to say I did the minimum effort possible -- I actually took pride in exceeding what was necessary when I became engrossed with a concept, e.g: Wrote three short stories out of inspiration from a card game's flavor text for a paragraph long journal entry.

College came around, and I only had a single writing class to take. There's a whole host of complaints in store about it, but it made me realize how little I get to exercise my writing muscles. Much like working out though, it was a weak spot I acknowledged needed work but that I took no steps to remedy. 

I've had a lot of free time this summer, and a lot of time to think about what I want to do. Starting a blog was one thing but its end goal isn't to improve my writing so much as it is a way to organize my thoughts. However, after stumbling on an old website, I realized I can use the same infrastructure / approach at improving my writing.

Enter [ommatidia](http://www.ommatidia.org/2007/11/30/alaric/), the inspiration to a little side project of mine. Ommatidia has a bunch of mainly but not exclusively standalones 100-word stories. You know what's easy to do in one sitting? Writing 100 word stories. Thus my new side project: Three 100ish-word stories a week to build some momentum and writing skills. 

Note: I haven't decided yet if I'll post them here or under a different name. They don't exist online yet.
