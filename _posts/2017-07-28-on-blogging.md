
I have been kicking around the idea of starting a blog since finishing highschool. Not for you, the reader. 

Just for myself.

I feel I have problems organizing my thoughts and mentally structuring "lessons learned" after events. Ask me what I learned at CCDC (*Collegiate Cyber Defence Competition*, an event I've wanted to do a write-up on for a while) and you will get a long-winded response of anecdotes. Maybe, if we're lucky, I'll remember to end it with a quick sentence about skills and working under pressure. 

This blog's main purpose is for me to practice writing down my thoughts. Its second purpose is for me to be able to have a repository in which I can see my own writing and criticize it. Lastly, it will hopefully contain some useful write-ups about experiences I have to repeat rather often. 

*Current goal: Use less contractions in writing.*
